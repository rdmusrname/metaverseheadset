Consumers can virtually try on clothing, accessories, and other products  assessing their fit  style, and  appearance from the comfort of their own homes. This eliminates the  hassle of physical fitting rooms saving  time and enhancing convenience.

VR shopping enables brands to create immersive  and interactive experiences that transcend the boundaries of  traditional retail.
